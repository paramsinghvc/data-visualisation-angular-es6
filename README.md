Make sure you have karma-cli, gulp, bower and npm installed globally before following the given steps from the root directory.

If not, run `sudo npm install -g karma-cli gulp bower`

Run `npm install`

Run `bower install`

Run `gulp`

For running the karma test cases in phantomjs

Run `karma start`

Caveat : In case you face any problem in running karma, make sure you don't have karma installed globally, instead you must have karma-cli installed globally. Also upgrade to the latest version of node through nvm.
